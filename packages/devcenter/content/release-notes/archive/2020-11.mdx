### New Mobify Cloud APIs for managing project users and permissions
A new set of REST APIs are available to integrate, which will allow teams to programmatically set who is a member of a project, and what actions they are allowed to take.

The new APIs are documented as part of the [Mobify Cloud API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud).

**Project User and Permissions API**
- [List Project Members API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#List%20Projects%20Members)
- [Add Project Member API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#List%20Projects%20Members)
- [Get Project Member API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#List%20Projects%20Members)
- [Update Project Member API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#List%20Projects%20Members)
- [Delete Project Member API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#List%20Projects%20Members)

We have also made available an [OpenAPI definition](https://swagger.io/specification/) for the [Mobify Cloud APIs](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud), which can be used with API tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to explore or auto-generate API client libraries in any programming language of choice.
