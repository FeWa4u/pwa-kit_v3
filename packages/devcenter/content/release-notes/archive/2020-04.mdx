Released on April 2nd 2020, corresponding to version `v2.0` of our SDKs.

In this release, we’re shipping the next major release of our platforms SDKs, v2.0! This version features several big changes. Find out all about v2.0 in [our latest blog post](https://www.mobify.com/insights/product-release-mobify-platform-sdks-v2-0/) or read a summary in the release notes below.

With general availability of v2.0, SDK features will default to v2.0. Going forward, v1.0 of our SDKs will receive patches for critical issues only. V1.0 will follow our regular support policy for [end of life](/resources/support-policy#end-of-life).

On top of v2.0, we’re also rolling out a brand new documentation site with the [DevCenter](https://dev.mobify.com), which will be the new host for v2.0 documentation, and a new feature to set up and manage storefront redirects.

### DevCenter (dev.mobify.com)

We’re excited to announce our new documentation site, [DevCenter](https://dev.mobify.com). The DevCenter will become the new home for any documentation related to v2.0 and beyond. Our original documentation site, [docs.mobify.com](https://docs.mobify.com), will continue to be used to host any documentation for v1.0 of the Platform.

The DevCenter aims to address a few key friction points uncovered on docs.mobify.com through:
- A powerful new search engine, which improves search accuracy, features categorization, and auto-suggested search results.
- An improved information architecture, revised through testing and feedback on our previous documentation system.
- A new modern design, with all content accessible through one site.

As you try the DevCenter, we’d love your feedback! Please let us know what you think using our [feedback form](/resources/feedback).

### Application Delivery Network

#### URL redirect management

As teams move to headless architectures, they require front-end capabilities such as creating and managing redirect rules for promotional campaigns and SEO preservation. 

Teams can now access a new set of [Redirect APIs](/apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#list-redirects) and a new part of the [Mobify Cloud](https://cloud.mobify.com/) user interface to create, edit and delete redirects. Redirect rules from one target can be cloned to another target, allowing migration of rules to and from `production` after testing. With these new features, teams can manage standard redirect rules for any environment without the need to deploy code changes.

More details on how to manage URL redirects are available in our new [DevCenter article](/how-to-guides/categories/design/using-url-redirects). This new feature is compatible with both v1.0 and v2.0 of our SDKs.

### Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

#### Server Side Rendering (SSR)

For context, read more about how this SSR architecture came to life through our [blog post](https://www.mobify.com/insights/server-side-rendering-mobify/).

V2.0 ships with our brand new server-side rendering architecture, Node SSR. It aims to provide developers with an SSR environment that’s both familiar and modern. The Node SSR environment uses a combination of Node.js and Express.js, and closely follows how React approaches SSR. Important details about Node SSR include:

- Uses widely-known and highly-adopted industry skills in React SSR and Express.js
    - Developers who are well-versed in server-side rendering with React and in Express.js will feel right at home with Node SSR.
- Unlocks the ability to easily use any Node.js package to extend application functionality
    - Your Mobify application is now an Express.js app, making it easier for developers to use any Express.js middleware or Node.js package of their choosing.
- Reduces friction in using the full React ecosystem
    - Node SSR brings us closer to a typical React ecosystem. As a result, Mobify’s libraries work better with third-party libraries in a React ecosystem.
    
#### React Router v5

V2.0-powered projects will ship with the latest version of [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start), v.5.1.2 as their default routing library. Check out all the new features and updates available with React Router v5 through their [blog](https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-router-v5/).

#### SDK package clean-up

V2.0 is dedicated to supporting full front-end projects. To that point, we’ve taken the opportunity with v2.0 to remove obsolete and unused APIs, libraries, and utilities that were previously used to maintain backwards compatibility:

- **Analytics Manager:** Analytics Manager is replaced by the [Analytics Integrations](/apis-and-sdks/progressive-web-sdk/analytics-integrations/overview) library.
- **Integration Manager:** Integration Manager is replaced by the [Commerce Integrations](/apis-and-sdks/commerce-integrations/overview) library.
- **iframe Bridge:** The iframe bridge never met Mobify’s performance standards when used, and as a result will not be ported over to v2.0.
- **Mobify’s Command Line Interface (CLI):** The Mobify CLI is challenging to work with in its current form. As it isn’t being heavily used, we’ve decided to remove it in v2.0.
- **Mobify Test Framework:** Mobify’s Test Framework was developed to simplify automated Lighthouse and Nightwatch testing on the Platform. The value of the Framework has reduced over time, so we’ve decided to remove it from v2.0.
- **Non-PWA Push Messaging:** Mobify is sunsetting web push notifications by the end of June, 2020. As a result, we’ve removed all remaining traces of web push notifications from v2.0.

#### Decoupling Redux

Redux has shipped as the default state management library ever since the first version of our SDKs. This changes for v2.0 as a result of recent developer feedback together with leaner alternatives now available in the React ecosystem. For example, we’ve observed many of the key Redux features being cherry-picked into React’s core, such as the Context API and React Hooks.

By default, V2.0 generated projects will now purely use React. In addition, all of Mobify’s SDKs have been completely decoupled from Redux. With this change, any lost functionality will be provided by React. These changes will help ensure developers have the freedom and flexibility they need to use any state management library.

#### Moving Webpack configs

While planning for v2.0, we learned that some developers found our pre-configured Webpack to be difficult to follow. To address developers’ feedback, we’ve moved the Webpack configuration into the SDK, and set up a much smaller Webpack configuration within the project scaffold. Now, the configuration has been simplified to start with an import of the webpack configuration from the SDK. This should improve overall readability, while still allowing developers to extend, edit, or completely override the default configuration.

#### Removing Lerna

Beginning from v1.12.0, Mobify projects were generated as monorepos and managed by the tool [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). Since then, we've noticed that Lerna was making it more difficult for developers to manage their projects, and recognize that Lerna isn’t as widely understood and adopted as other tools and libraries within our tech stack. By default, v2.0 projects will no longer use Lerna, and they will no longer be set up as monorepos.

### Application Delivery Network

#### New Target Deletion API

A new [API](/apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#delete-target) enables teams to remove targets they no longer needed. Please keep your projects tidy by deleting targets you’re no longer using!

<p class="c-label c--bugs">Bug Fixes</p>

### PWA SDK

- Addressed an issue where developers were not able to set `content-type` headers within `GET` requests.
- Addressed an issue with the [Accordion component](/apis-and-sdks/component-library/components/Accordion). We observed that the component’s `data-analytics-content` key was sometimes rendering with the string representation of an object, instead of an object.
- Addressed an issue with the [`EngagementEngine` connector](/apis-and-sdks/progressive-web-sdk/analytics-integrations/connectors/engagement-engine) for the Analytics Integration library. In some situations, we discovered that the `location` field was being set incorrectly for [analytics events](/apis-and-sdks/progressive-web-sdk/analytics-integrations/overview#events).
- Updated the error handling for projects’ `router` files. Now, a critical error is thrown when a project’s `router` file cannot be analyzed by our SDKs.

### Commerce Integrations

- Addressed an issue with the `EngagementEngine` connector for the Analytics Integration library. In some situations, we discovered that the `location` field was being set incorrectly for analytics events.
- Updated the [`SalesforceConnector`’s](/apis-and-sdks/commerce-integrations/connectors/sfcc) error handling to include error details directly from the [Salesforce API](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC2/index.jsp).

### Others

- Incorrect permissions for Deployer role fixed for the [Deploy API](/apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud/#deploy-a-bundle).
