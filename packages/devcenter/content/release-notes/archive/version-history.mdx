## Introduction

Mobify releases a new version of `progressive-web-sdk` every six weeks, including new features, enhancements to the SDK and scaffold, bug fixes, security patches, and key product documentation. To facilitate smooth upgrades for our partners and customers, releases are designed to incrementally improve the Mobify Platform, rather than introducing large breaking changes.

Improvements to our backend infrastructure are done outside of the product release process, in a system of continuous improvement. As a result, they’re not versioned. Examples include our Application Delivery Network and Mobify Cloud.

We recommend staying up to date with the latest Mobify Platform version, to access the latest features, patches, and bug fixes. To find a detailed summary of each release, check out our [Release Notes](/release-notes).

## Mobify Platform repository structure

Prior to March 2019, the packages Mobify publishes to NPM used an independent versioning scheme. That meant, for example, that a Mobify Platform release may have included version 1.2.3 of the `progressive-web-sdk` and version 3.2.1 of `@mobify/commerce-integrations`.

In March 2019 we switched to a synchronized versioning scheme, which makes it easier to understand which package versions were released together, and have been tested to work together by Mobify. If you're upgrading packages in your project we recommend updating all Mobify packages together, to the same version number.

The following packages have used synchronized version numbers since version 1.11:

-   `progressive-web-sdk`
-   `@mobify/commerce-integrations`
-   `@mobify/documentation-theme`

## Checking your Mobify Platform version number

There are two ways to look up your version of the Mobify Platform.

For one, you can find your `progressive-web-sdk` version inside the `package.json` file, which is found under your project's root folder. For projects operating on version 1.10 or lower, the `package.json` file will show the versions for each library.

## Tag-loaded and server-side rendered apps

Depending on your project, there are two different approaches to creating an application using the Mobify Platform: tag-loaded and server-side rendered.

### Server-side rendered apps

Introduced in November 2018, Mobify's server-side rendering is a technique for rendering what would normally be a client-side only React application on the server and sending a fully-rendered page to the client. Once on the client, the browser then loads the app's Javascript code which takes over all subsequent rendering. These applications can be crawled by search engines, including by crawlers that don't execute Javascript code. Another benefit is better perceived performance – users can immediately see the server-side rendered page without waiting for Javascript to load on the client before the first page render.

### Tag-loaded apps

The Mobify tag is Mobify's early technique for building applications, introduced in 2011. It's a snippet of HTML and JavaScript which loads an app, typically a PWA, into an existing web page. If you’re building or maintaining an app that renders only on the client-side without making use of Mobify’s server-side rendering, you'll be working on a tag-loaded project using the Mobify tag.

## Milestones in Mobify Platform versions

The following list summarizes major technical milestones in Mobify’s Progressive Web SDK. For a full list of changes, visit our [Release Notes](/release-notes). Typically, we find that partner developers are most interested in knowing their version for the project scaffold (project starting point), and knowing their version for our Commerce and Analytics Integrations SDKs.
