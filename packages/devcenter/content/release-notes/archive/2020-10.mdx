- Guaranteeing isolation between deployed customer resources
- Automatic management of Transport Layer Security versions
- New Cloud APIs for User and Bundle management
- Support for deploying XML files.

### Increased Application Delivery Network capacity and improved resource isolation
As more projects get deployed to the same region across our Application Delivery Network, there is increased competition for resources due to regional limits. 

We’ve now implemented account-based sharding, where customer projects will no longer be sharing the same regional resource pool. All active projects have been migrated into the new setup, and now have access to a higher upper limit of deployed environments and traffic capacity. 

### Transport Layer Security (TLS) version management
The TLS versions are now automatically managed on all targets on behalf of customers. Previously, we allowed customers to set a specific version, which could negatively affect security and PCI compliance. All deployments now use TLS 1.2 and 1.3, along with a modern set of ciphers. 

As part of this, Mobify no longer supports shoppers on older browsers that only use TLS 1.0 or 1.1. Impact is expected to be low, as 97.8% of all browsers are compatible with TLS 1.2 or above. You can [review](https://caniuse.com/tls1-2) the impacted set of legacy browsers that aren’t compatible with TLS 1.2. 

### New Mobify Cloud APIs for user accounts and project bundles
A new set of REST APIs are available to integrate, which will allow teams to programmatically manage user account details and list available bundles to deploy in a project, if they have the correct permissions.

The new APIs are documented as part of the [Mobify Cloud API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud).

**User Account Management**
- [Read User API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#Read%20User)
- [Update User API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#Update%20User)

**Project Bundles**
- [List Bundles API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#List%20Bundles)

**Bundle Deployment**
- [Create Deploy API](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud#Create%20Deploy)

We have also made available an [OpenAPI definition](https://swagger.io/specification/) for the [Mobify Cloud APIs](../../apis-and-sdks/mobify-cloud), which can be used with API tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to explore or auto-generate API client libraries in any programming language of choice. 

### XML file deployments
The Application Deployment Network only allows specific file types to be deployed for security reasons. Projects can now deploy xml files as part of their bundles, such as serving `sitemap.xml` to search crawlers.

### Protecting targets with HTTP Basic Auth
The Application Deployment Network now supports pass-through of the `Authorization` header, allowing customers to add Basic Auth to project code for protecting non-production environments from unintended access.

Projects can enable this by using the [express-basic-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-basic-auth) package with code similar to:
```
// ssr.js
import basicAuth from 'express-basic-auth'

// ...

app.use(
    basicAuth({
        users: {example: 'example'},
        challenge: true,
        realm: 'storefront'
    })
)

app.get('/*', render)
```

<p class="c-label c--known">Known Issues</p>

- Projects who wish to use the `react-intl` library for managing internationalization concerns need to follow specific steps to ensure the full ICU data set is available in the deployed environment by following our [updated documentation](../../how-to-guides/categories/internationalization/internationalization-and-localization-with-react-intl) on react-intl usage.
