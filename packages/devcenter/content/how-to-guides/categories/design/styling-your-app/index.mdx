The project scaffold includes a stylesheet `main.css` in `<PROJECT_DIR>/app`.

On `npm start`, webpack creates `main.css` by applying [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) to `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/stylesheet.scss`. 

_It also watches for changes, so you can refresh to see them._

You can style your app by changing the following types of imports in `stylesheet.scss`:

1. SCSS variables
2. Component styles
3. Preloader styles

Let's look at each type of styling in more detail...

## SCSS variables

Colors, fonts, weights, breakpoints and shared values are set in `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/styles/_variables.scss`.

_Changing this file is the best way to start branding your app!_

## Component styles

**Local components** SCSS files are in `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/components/*`. Local components use the class name prefix `c-`.

The SCSS files for our components are in `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/styles/themes/pw-components/`. For styling SDK components, use the class name prefix `pw-`.

Some SDK components do not have an SCSS file. Customize them by creating one and importing it in `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/styles/themes/_pw-components.scss`.

**Page components** SCSS files are in `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/pages/*`. Page components use the class name prefix `t-`. (Pages were formerly called "templates," but the prefix remains unchanged.)

## Preloader styles

The Preloader is shown while the app starts.

_It should be light-weight, both visually and in file-size._

The Preloader CSS file is `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/preloader/preloader.css`.

The Preloader uses CSS, not SCSS like the rest of the app.

## Referencing assets in SCSS

To reference images in SCSS, use a path relative to `<PROJECT_DIR>/app` regardless of where the source file is located.

For example, to reference `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/static/img/global/image.png`:

```scss
.c-banner {
    .c--free-ship {
        background-image: url('./static/img/global/free-shipping-banner.png');
    }
}
```
