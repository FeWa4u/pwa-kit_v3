Maybe you are just overseeing the project and you have some staff doing the technical work for you. How can you set up permissions and manage who is working on your project? This guide will teach you how to add and remove members from your team as well as how to manage what kind of permissions each team member has.

## Prerequisites
A Mobify Cloud account

## Roles Overview
There are a number of different roles that a team member can have on a project. Each role has different abilities. Here is a breakdown of the types of roles, and what each action can do.

## Adding Team Members
To add a user to a your team, navigate to the your project settings page, click **Settings** in the side menu, then scroll to the bottom of the page. Under the **Team Members** section, there is a button labled **Add Team Member**. Click it and a form will appear. Enter the email of the user you want to add, select their permissions level from the drop down, and click the Add button. Your new team member will now appear in the list of team members.

If the user is not in the Mobify Cloud system when you try to add them, an invite email will be sent to them to set up their account.

## Removing Team Members
To remove a user from a project, go to the project settings page. Find the user you want to remove under the **Team Members** section and click the **X** button beside their role. You will have to confirm the delete in order for it to take effect. After confirming, the user will no longer appear in your list of team members.

## Changing Roles
To change the role for a user, find the user you are looking for in the **Team Members** section of the **Settings** page. Choose the desired role from that user's drop down. To save the role change, click the Update Roles button.

You should see a success message at the top of your screen once the changes have been saved.

## FAQ
### Can you remove all users from a project?
No. A project must have at least one admin.

### Can a team member have multiple roles?
No. Each team member only has one role.

### What happens when you add a user who isn't already in the system?
If you add a user that doesn't have a Mobify Cloud account, they will be sent an invite via email. An account will get created for them and they will show up on your list of team members.

### Who can see team members and their roles?
Only project administrators can see and change team members.
