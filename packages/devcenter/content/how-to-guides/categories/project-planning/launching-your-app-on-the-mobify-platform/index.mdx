**This guide covers launching an app on the Mobify Platform.** For example, imagine we want to launch a Mobify site at `www.example.com` using the project `example` and target `production`.

To launch, we must:

1. Allow Mobify to manage TLS certificates for the `www.example.com` domain.
2. Configure the `production` target to receive traffic with the host `www.example.com`.
3. Modify our [DNS CNAME record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) to resolve `www.example.com` to `example-production-cdn.mobify-storefront.com`.

Let's go through those steps in detail.

## Pre-launch Steps

Complete these steps as soon as you begin your project:

**1. Create a `staging` target**

Use the [Mobify Cloud API](/how-to-guides/categories/deployment/using-the-mobify-api-for-target-management) to create a `staging` target:

```bash
curl 'https://cloud.mobify.com/api/projects/example/target/' \
  --request 'POST' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MOBIFY_API_KEY" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name": "staging"}'
```

_We'll use the `staging` target to practice launching._

**2. Confirm your API is publicly available**

Your app must access your ecommerce backend. It may be nessecary to make your API available a new domain.

Imagine `www.example.com` currently resolves to an ecommerce backend. After launch, `www.example.com` will resolve to Mobify. Mobify needs a way to address the ecommerce backend. You may choose to make the ecommerce backend available at `api.example.com` and update your target's [proxy settings](/how-to-guides/categories/server-side-rendering/using-proxies) to use it.

**3. Allow Mobify to issue TLS Certificates**

To allow Mobify to issue a TLS certificate for your domain, you must create a DNS CNAME record. [Contact Mobify for details](https://support.mobify.com/support/home).

You must create the record **within 24 hours** of receiving the details. As an example, DNS CNAME record will look like this: `_xyz.example.com` to `_abc.acm-validations.aws`

## Test Launch

**Always test the launch process on `staging` first.**

Imagine we're launching `staging.example.com` with the project `example` and the target `staging`:

**1. Reduce DNS CNAME TTL**

Reduce the DNS TTL for `staging.example.com` to one minute. _This make DNS cutover fast, and if something goes wrong, allows for fast rollback._

Verify the TTL using [`dig`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)>):

```bash
dig +nocmd +noall +answer 'staging.example.com'
```

**2. Configure your staging target domain**

Configure the target to receive traffic from the host `staging.example.com`.

Update the target's `ssr_external_domain` and `ssr_external_hostname` using the API:

```bash
curl 'https://cloud.mobify.com/api/projects/example/target/staging/' \
  --request 'PATCH' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $MOBIFY_API_KEY" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"ssr_external_domain": "example.com", "ssr_external_hostname": "staging.example.com", }'
```

:::important
After this step, the target will no longer be accessible at its
`mobify-storefront.com` domain.
:::

Verify the configuration using [`cURL`](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/04/05/curl-another-host/) to make a request with DNS spoofing:

```bash
curl 'https://staging.example.com' \
    --resolve 'staging.example.com:443:'"$(dig +short 'example-staging-cdn.mobify-storefront.com' | tail -n1)"
```

**3. Perform the DNS cutover**

Mobify will provide you with a stable domain following the convention `$PROJECT-$TARGET-cdn.mobify-storefront.com` where `$PROJECT` is your project ID, and `$TARGET` is your target ID.

Update the DNS CNAME record for `staging.example.com` to `example-staging-cdn.mobify-storefront.com`.

Open your web browser and navigate to `staging.example.com`.

Congrats, you've completed your test launch! ðŸ¥³

## Production Launch

When you're ready to launch, complete the same steps as the test launch, but with your `production` target and domain.

From here, Mobify engineers will assist you in monitoring the site's traffic. The goal is to ensure that everything happens as expected during launch!

## Technical Limitiations

-   The `ssr_external_domain` target setting controls which host the target recieves traffic from. If the HTTP `Host` header of a request does not match this value, the request will fail.
-   Currently, Mobify does not support bare domains. As part of your launch plan, setup a server to redirect direct requests to the bare domain to your CNAME.
