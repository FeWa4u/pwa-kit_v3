:::note
We’re updating Mobify with additional security measures. After **April 12, 2021**, you will only be able to log in through a Salesforce Commerce Cloud account. 
:::

To prepare for this transition, here’s what your team can expect prior to the transition:

* Users that do not have a Salesforce Commerce Cloud account will receive an invite to create a new account. We recommend setting up multi-factor authentication for additional security.
* Users that already have a Salesforce Commerce Cloud account will be granted additional organizational roles to continue accessing Mobify.
* Customers who do not have a Salesforce Commerce Cloud organization in [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com/) will have one created, along with an Account Administrator assigned to manage future account changes.

For any critical issues, please log an "Urgent" severity ticket through [support.mobify.com](http://support.mobify.com/)  or contact us at [support@mobify.com](mailto:support@mobify.com), and our team will assist.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I continue to use my existing email/password login?
Your email/password login will continue to work, up until your first login with your Commerce Cloud credentials.

### Will my ability to deploy and publish bundles be affected?
Your individual API keys will be unaffected by this change, and will continue to work for deploying and publishing bundles from command line interface and build scripts.

### How will I be able to change my password in the future?
All profile and password management will be done in [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com/).

### How will I give access to my Mobify projects to new team members in the future?
Organization Account Administrators in [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com/) will be able to invite additional users and grant them the required *Commerce Runtime Manager User* role to access Mobify. Project access and permissions will continue to be managed directly in Mobify.
