Kickstart your Mobify Platform project with this complete guide. Install required software and dependencies and run your project locally for the first time!

## System requirements

### Supported operating systems

The Mobify Platform supports the following operating systems:

-   macOS 10.13 or greater
-   Windows 7 or greater
-   Ubuntu Linux 18.x or greater

### Recommended hardware

We recommend the following for your hardware setup, at a minimum:

-   16 GB RAM
-   Solid-state drive (SSD)
-   2 or more CPU cores

## Node and NPM

### Supported versions

We currently support versions ^10.17.0 and ^12.x of Node. Whenever possible, we recommend
using the more recent of the two. Other versions of Node are not supported and may result
in unexpected errors once your project is deployed.

:::important
If you need to manage multiple versions of Node, we recommend that Windows users install [Volta](https://volta.sh/) and avoid using Corey Butler's Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows.

For Mac and Linux users, we recommend installing [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Installation

Before you start development, you’ll need to install specific versions of Node and Node Package Manager (NPM) on
any computers that you plan to use for development.

1. Go to the [Node 12.x download page](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/) and download the right installer for your machine.

    **Windows users**: Download the `.msi` file that corresponds to your processor. For example, if you have a 64-bit Intel processor, you would choose the `x64` installer.

    **Mac users**: Download the `.pkg` file.

    **Linux users**: Download the `-linux` file that corresponds to your processor. For example, if you have a 64-bit Intel processor, you would choose the `linux-x64` installer in your preferred archive format.

1. Run the installer and complete the setup instructions.

1. When prompted by the installer, accept the default option to also install the Node.js runtime, install Node Package Manager, and add the Node.js runtime to your path.

### Verifying installations

1. Open a terminal (or the Command Prompt on Windows)

1. Run `node -v`

    It should return `v12.21.0` (or the latest `12.x` version)

1. Run `npm -v`

    It should return `6.14.11`

### Installing NPM manually

If you have a different version of NPM installed, you can install version `6.14.11` manually.

1. Open a terminal (or the Command Prompt on Windows)

1. Run `npm install -g npm@6.14.11`

1. Run `npm -v` again

    It should now return `6.14.11`

## Project files

In most cases, a project will already be generated for you and managed in a code repository. Reach out to your team lead for access to the repository.

To generate a new project from scratch, open a terminal (or the Command Prompt on Windows) and run the following command:

```bash
npx @mobify/create-app
```

## Installing dependencies

To download and install package dependencies, open a terminal (or the Command Prompt on Windows) and run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm ci
```

:::note
It might take a few minutes before you see any activity, so don’t cancel the process until it finishes. Thanks for your patience!

## Start your dev server

To start your local web server for local development, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Now that the development server is running, you can open your commerce app in a browser:

-   Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

**Success!** You should now see the home page for your app.

To preview a server-side rendered page, append the `?mobify_server_only` query string to the URL you'd like to preview. For example, you can test the server-side rendered version of `www.example.com` by visiting the URL `www.example.com?mobify_server_only`.

You can stop the development server at any time by using the keyboard shortcut `Control-C`.
