metaDescription: A summary of the Mobify Platform’s main technologies, highlighting how they’re used in the Platform.

The Mobify Platform uses several core technologies that are written in JavaScript and distributed through Node Package Manager (NPM). Some of these technologies were developed by the open-source community and others were developed by Mobify. In this overview, we’ll explain the key concepts behind each core technology and highlight the related NPM packages that extend their functionality and help you build your applications.

## React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a framework developed by Facebook to create [single-page apps](https://flaviocopes.com/single-page-application/) that deliver fast, fluid, and immersive user interfaces.

In a React app, the user interface is built with discrete _components_ that are typically arranged in complex hierarchies. In a well-designed React app, each component is only responsible for one job—and often that job is just to contain other components.

The base class for a React component takes one argument, an object called `props` (short for “properties”). All the data needed to render a React component must come from the props object.

### Packages related to React

[ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html)

-   Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your application

[ReactDOMServer](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html)

-   Provides the method `renderToString()` that can pre-render HTML on the server
-   Package name: `react-dom/server`
-   Developed and maintained by: Facebook

[React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet/blob/master/README.md)

-   Helps you manage changes to the document's `<head>` tag
-   Package name: `react-helmet`
-   Developed and maintained by: NFL Engineering

[Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/)

-   Speeds up performance through code-splitting of larger bundles
-   Package name: `@loadable/components`
-   Developed and maintained by: Greg Bergé

[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

-   Maps URL paths to React components
-   Package name: `react-router`
-   Developed and maintained by: ReactTraining

## State management

While building your project, you can choose to manage global state through a state management library, or through React on its own.

To manage global state with React, you can use [React’s Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), which is based on [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

There are also many state management libraries out there such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html).

For more information about managing state, read our article on [Managing Global State in a React App](/how-to-guides/categories/state-management/managing-global-state).

## Node.js

All the server-side code for a Mobify application is run on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), an open source JavaScript runtime environment. The runtime environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and includes APIs to access features of the host operating system (such as the file system) in a cross-platform way.

Node.js uses a non-blocking or asynchronous architecture, which is ideal for building highly-scalable and data-intensive backend apps. Its package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest collection of open source libraries in the world.

## Express.js

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a popular open-source web server framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the Node.js runtime environment. It allows developers to handle HTTP requests for different URL paths (routes).

Express allows you to configure common web server settings, such as the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates for rendering the response. It also allows you to add additional request processing [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) at any point within the request handling pipeline.

## Developer tools

The Mobify Platform includes a variety of developer tools, including the following packages:

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/)

-   Converts your Javascript code into a backwards-compatible version so that it can be run in a wide range of browsers. Specifically, it converts JSX syntax to Javascript syntax and ES6 syntax to ES5 syntax.
-   Package name: `babel-*`
-   Developed and maintained by: Babel

[Bluebird](https://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html)

-   A promise-handling library which enables task-splitting in your application, a key method to optimize performance. In Mobify projects, it’s used to ensure we have promises, and to standardize how the promises work.
-   Package name: `bluebird`
-   Developed and maintained by: Petka Antonov

[Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

-   Provides a "linter," an analysis tool that helps highlight code syntax and style issues without having to execute it
-   Package name: `eslint`
-   Developed and maintained by: Eslint

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

-   A testing framework for JavaScript code
-   Package name: `jest`
-   Developed and maintained by: Facebook

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

-   Consolidates Mobify's application modules into one or more bundles for the end user to download
-   Package name: `webpack`
-   Developed and maintained by: Webpack

## Styling

The Mobify Platform uses several technologies for styling, including:

[Classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames/blob/master/README.md)

-   Makes dynamic and conditional `className` props simpler and easier to work with
-   Package name: `classnames`
-   Developed and maintained by: Jed Watson

[Node-Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)

-   Allows fast and automatic compiling of CSS preprocessor files (Sassy CSS, or .scss) files to css. CSS preprocessors enable you to become more productive with CSS, through the added convenience of variables, modularity, and inheritance.
-   Package name: `node-sass`
-   Developed and maintained by: Sass

[Susy](https://www.oddbird.net/susy/)

-   Helps you build [readable and robust responsive grid systems](/how-to-guides/categories/design/creating-responsive-layout-grids-with-susy)
-   Package name: `susy`
-   Developed and maintained by: Oddbird
