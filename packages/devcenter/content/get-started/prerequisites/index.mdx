**This guide covers the technical skills required to get started working with Mobify.**

The Mobify Platform is a front-end as a service for developing [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) based storefronts for Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) using [Commerce API](https://developer.commercecloud.com/s/commerce-api). To use it effectively, developers must have experience:

-   Building [universal](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) React.js applications using [ES6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
-   Working with RESTful APIs like SFCC Commerce API
-   Developing Node.js based web applications with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
-   Using modern JavaScript build tools like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
-   Using `npm` to manage packages and run scripts

A complete list of skills used in creating a Mobify project is found below.

## JavaScript

The Mobify Platform uses code written in JavaScript. Developers must have intermediate experience with modern JavaScript.

### ES6+ Fundamentals, Data Fetching and Concurrency

-   Mobify apps make network requests, so knowledge of [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is crucial. Familiarity universal fetch libraries that work both in browser and Node.js environments like [`cross-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) is recommended.
    -   Suggested Reading: [MDN: Fetch API - Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
    -   Reference Guide: [`fetch()` cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/js-fetch)
-   Fetching data is asynchronous. Developers should be familiar with [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)s and [`async` and `await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function).

### React.js

-   Mobify apps are built using the React.js open source framework. Developers must have previously worked on React apps.
    -   Suggested Reading: [All of the React.js Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
-   Developers must be familiar with managing state in React apps.
    -   Suggested Reading:
        -   [Components and Props -- React](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
        -   [State Management](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react)
        -   [Lifecycle + State](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
-   Developers must be familiar with React Lifecycle hooks and React 16.8+ concepts:
    -   Suggested Reading: [Context](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively), [Error Boundaries](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-react-error-boundary-to-handle-errors-in-react), [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
-   Developers should be familiar with debugging React apps using [React DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en).
-   Developers should be familiar with using React.js open source extensions like [`react-router`](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) and [`react-helmet`](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).

### Node.js

-   Developers should be familiar with the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) web server.
-   Developers should be comfortable [debugging](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/) Node.js applications.

### JavaScript Ecosystem

-   Developers must be comfortable managing [`npm` packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-commands/install.html).
-   Using [`npm-run-scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-commands/run-script.html).
-   Have experiene using JavaScript build tools like [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/).

### CSS

<!-- Storefronts must be styled using CSS. -->

-   Developers should be familiar with responsive web design layout techniques using [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) and the [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) and [grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) properties.

## Salesforce Commerce Cloud Commerce API

Mobify powered storefronts get data from Salesforce Commerce Cloud using Commerce API. Developers must be familiar with the API, and be familiar with working with RESTful APIs.

-   Commerce Cloud APIs
    -   Suggested Reading: [Commerce API](https://developer.commercecloud.com/s/commerce-api)
-   [B2C Commerce Developer Sandbox Rest API](https://admin.us01.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com/)
-   HTTP Networking and Caching

## Additional Skills

Depending on the details of the project, additional skills may be required:

-   General knowledge of Single Page Applications.
-   Knowledge of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and the [PWA Checklist](https://web.dev/pwa-checklist/).
-   Experience architecting headless commerce applications including knowledge of the backend for frontend pattern.
-   Interacting with APIs using a scripting language like Node.js or tools like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
-   Web page performance testing using Lighthouse and WebPageTest.
-   Knowledge of web analytics.
-   Knowledge of search engine optimization.
